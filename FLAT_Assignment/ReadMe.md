Flat Assignment No. 31 â€“ Morphological Analyzer (English)

## Description ##
This project implements a **basic morphological analyzer for English words** using **C++ and the OpenFst library**.  

The program takes an **English word as input**, analyzes it, and outputs its **root word + part of speech (POS) + grammatical feature**.  
It also constructs and saves an **FST (Finite-State Transducer)** representation of the input word.  

This is a **rule-based morphological analyzer**, focusing on common English suffixes like **`-ing`, `-ed`, `-er`, `-est`, `-ly`**.
